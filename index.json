If a single sheet is used, one obtains a single-walled nanotube (SWNT), while several nested SWNTs give a multi-walled nanotube (MWNT), a double-walled nanotube (DWNT) being a special case of these. These all-carbon macromolecules are known to have superb mechanical (e.g. Young modulus of ~1TPa and tensile strengths up to 53GPa), electrical (e.g. ballistic conduction and current carrying capacities up to 4x10 9A/cm2), and thermal (e.g. thermal conductivity of 3500W/mK along the tube axis) properties.\nIn 2004, a unique method for the continuous production of CNT fibres and films was developed by Prof. Alan Windle\u0026rsquo;s group 1, part of the MML. In this method, an “elastic CNT smoke” is formed in the CVD reaction zone of a vertical furnace in which a carbon source is decomposed in the presence of floating iron catalyst particles in a reducing atmosphere. This smoke can be pulled out of the reactor and continuously wound onto a spool – a process somewhat similar to making candy-floss. Winding the material up without any further densification results in a CNT film. Alternatively, the material may be densified into a yarn-like fibre by an in-line process in which a solvent is sprayed on it, generating capillary forces that significantly reduce its diameter. Fibres made by this method already show mechanical properties comparable to those of high performance fibres such as Kevlar and Dyneema, with much better resistance to bending and knotting. They also show vastly superior electrical conductivities compared with carbon fibre and have an axial thermal conductivity of 1250 W/m.K which is some three times that of copper or 25 times better per unit weight.\nIn the MML group we keep working on perfecting our synthesis method, aiming for electrical conductivities capable of challenging copper and mechanical properties closer to those of individual CNTs. We also investigate the use of our fibres and films to make multifunctional composite materials.\nOver the past decade MML has developed a unique process for synthesizing carbon nanotubes via the floating catalyst route, and at the same time winding the entangled aerogel into a fibre. The process will work with a variety of different carbon feedstocks and generates a fibre with axial properties in the Kevlar range, but great robustness in bending.\nIt is thus possible to convert natural gas continuously into a high tech fibre in a single reactor. Current focus of the work is the improvement of mechanical, electrical and thermal properties for a wide range of applications, some of them multifunctional. Part of this activity is through enhanced control of the spinning process itself, other approaches rely on post spinning processes such as chemical functionalization of the fibre and heat and radiation treatments. The fibre’s unique mechanical robustness stems from the fact that it is a nanoscale yarn, which also means that when incorporated in composites, the matrix penetrates the fibre providing unique level of bonding with the matrix.\nY.-L.

Our aim is to produce composites of tailored properties and functionality: from nanotube loaded polymers for static dissipation to multifunctional composite fibres for smart textiles.\nComposite materials are made up of at least two distinguishable phases – usually called matrix and reinforcement – each with different physical and/or chemical properties. A matrix is a continuous phase that holds together one or several reinforcements; reinforcements are discrete particles or fibres that enhance the material\u0026rsquo;s properties (e.g. mechanical strength, electrical and thermal conductivities, abrasion resistance). Synergistic interactions between matrix and reinforcement(s) give composites properties not available from their separate constituents. An example of a natural composite is wood, in which cellulose fibres reinforce a lignin matrix; synthetic composites include concrete, plywood, and the advanced fibre-reinforced polymers used in aerospace and sports applications.\nThe Macromolecular Materials Laboratory focuses mainly on composites of which one of their phases consists of carbon nanotubes (CNTs): from CNT-reinforced polymers, in which the nanotubes are dispersed in the matrix to enhance the material\u0026rsquo;s strength and electrical conductivity, to composite fibres and films, in which a macroscopic CNT assembly acts as a porous matrix capable of holding large amounts of powders or continuous coatings that lend functionality to the material (e.g. superconductivity, actuation, catalysis, and sensing). We rely on a series of computational and characterisation techniques – including multiscale modeling, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray scattering (SAXS, WAXS), electron microscopy (SEM, HRTEM), mechanical testing (Favimat, DMA), and thermal analysis (TGA, DSC) – to investigate matrix-reinforcement interactions and structure-property relations in our composites.

This has the advantages of being both quicker and cheaper than a trial-and-error experimentation process, and also yields detailed structural and dynamical information that can provide a stringent test of theoretical models.\nAs computing power continues to increase at a relentless pace, it is tempting to consider the simulation of large and/or complex systems using brute force atomistic simulation methods alone. However, even extrapolating from current state-of-the-art methodologies, it would still take well over a century of exponential growth in computing resources to achieve parity with ‘real time’ simulations of experimental systems of macroscopic size and, in any case, the sheer amount of data produced would overwhelm any attempt at detailed scientific analysis. Therefore, it is imperative that we now seek to exploit the regions of overlap between well-established techniques for electronic structure calculations, molecular dynamics, mesoscopic simulations and continuum modelling to allow efficient multiscale simulations of increasingly complex condensed phase systems. Multiscale modelling is currently a powerful and widely-used tool in Materials Science, in which there have been significant technical and scientific advances over the last decade, enabling novel fields of application from nanotechnology to biomineralization.\nIn the MML group we utilise simulation techniques across all of the length scales above. At the electron scale, density functional theory and Hartree-Fock methods are used to calculate parameters ab initio. Expertise in using Materials Studio, CHARMM, AMBER, VMD, NAMD, LAMMPS, DL_POLY and many more force fields and simulation packages allow us to simulate molecular systems. In the mesoscale, coarse-grained molecular dynamics and dissipative particle dynamics are used to simulate even larger systems on timescales more comparable with experiments. Finally at the macroscopic scale the discrete element method and finite element method allow us to simulate processes which the naked eye can see.\n","permalink":"//mml-cambridge.github.io/research/modelling/","summary":"With modern computational techniques, it is now possible to predict the properties of novel materials from first principles using advanced simulation techniques.

They are important to many industries including pharmaceuticals, construction and food. Processes dealing with granular materials often occur over varying timescales, from long storage or transportation times to powder compaction, which occurs in the blink of an eye. Issues including processing history and storage conditions have an effect on the properties of the particles leading to changes in how granular systems respond to external stimuli.\nResearch into granular materials within the MML group contains good variety. Flow and adhesion properties of toner and carrier particles in a printer are of interest. This binary system requires particle interactions to allow for the fine toner particles to adhere to the bulkier carrier particles for deposition on the printed paper, whilst allowing carrier particles to be reused and preventing toner particles from forming clumps. The ring shear testing technique was used to investigate the flow properties of both model and real toner-carrier particle systems.\nPharmaceutical powders are also a current research area, especially when compacted to form tablets. The use of computational modelling and compaction simulators to investigate tablet production is of current interest. Computational simulations using quantum theory and molecular dynamics allow for investigations into the material properties of the powder. The discrete element method and the finite element method, in conjunction with the Drucker-Prager cap model can simulate entire pharmaceutical powder systems. Some of the work was conducted with the Pfizer Institute for Pharmaceutical Materials Science, with several members belonging to both the Pfizer Institute and the MML group.\n","permalink":"//mml-cambridge.github.io/research/granular/","summary":"Granular materials are able to flow similar to liquids, but are composed of solid particles.

For example, toughness and strength are two material properties that are generally mutually exclusive to each other - improving the strength of a man-made material usually tends to decrease its toughness.\nHowever, biological systems are able to overcome this through precise nanoscale controle of the amorphous and crystalline state. In systems such as skin, a combination of biologically produced fibers with differing elastic moduli work in synergy to resist extension. In biological composites, such as bones and teeth, precise control of the amorphous protein phase, the mineral phase, and crucially the interface between the two, are known to be resposible for their unique load-baring properties.\nThese materials tend to be hierarchical in nature, meaning that no single characterisation method or tool is suitible to providing a complete answer to the question of how their properties are related to their structure. Instead, we use a variety of tools, including vibrational spectroscopy, WAXS/SAXS, DFT, atomistic computer modelling, and coarse-graining.\n","permalink":"//mml-cambridge.github.io/research/biomaterials/","summary":"Biological systems and the materials they synthesise are of interest to materials scientists because they provide novel solutions to challenges involving synthetic materials.

Here follows a few examples.\nFavimat fibre tester The Textechno Favimat is an industrial device for testing the mechanical properties of individual fibres, suitable for fibres with very small diameters. It uses a vibroscopic method to determine the fibre’s linear density and a very sensitive load cell to measure strength and stiffness. Using specific properties (properties divided by density) allows us to compare our direct-spun CNT and nanocomposite-fibres against commercially-available high-performance fibres.\nRaman spectroscopy The Raman effect is a scattering phenomenon that provides chemical and structural information: the wavelength shifts between incident and inelastically scattered photons correspond to the energies of different molecular vibration modes. Raman spectroscopy can be applied in a wide range of materials – from pharmaceuticals to semiconductors – and is one of the most useful techniques for characterising carbon nanotubes (providing information about diameter, chirality, and defects), grapheme, and other, carbon-based, nanomaterials. The MML proudly owns a Bruker Senterra, providing measurements with different laser wavelengths and the possibility of automated 3D mapping (Raman intensity over 2D sample area).\nPolymer characterisation laboratory We have access to the department’s polymer characterisation laboratory which includes, amongst others, equipment for differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), evolved gas analysis (EGA), and infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). We use these techniques to study several properties of our nanostructured composite materials.\nX-ray scattering techniques Having access to the departmental X-ray facilities we’re able to study the structure of our nanomaterials (powders, fibres, or films) and composites reinforced with them. For us, one of the most useful pieces equipment is the Bruker Nanostar Gen7, capable of collecting both wide- and small-angle patterns (WAXS and SAXS) which probe the structure of our CNT fibres at the inter- and intrabundle levels, respectively; the device has also been used to study the effects of solvents on collagen and other macromolecules.\nElectron microscopy The group has access to the multiple electron microscopy facilities of the department, including scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) equipped with a focused ion beam (FIB) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and transmission electron microscopes (TEMs). SEM is one of the basic methods to get a first impression of the structure of a sample, while FIB provides the possibility to cut cross-sections and look – e.g. inside our spun CNT fibres – or to prepare thin samples for TEM. In the case of carbon nanotubes, TEM is mainly used to analyse, either by imaging or by electron diffraction, characteristics such as wall number and diameter, and defects or impurities present.\nElectrical characterisation equipment We have several house-built two- and four-point circuits and a Solartron ModuLab capable of performing frequency response, high voltage cell polarization, and low current measurement measurements. With these devices we can characterise the electrical properties of nanocomposites and assemblies of carbon nanotubes under several conditions (immersed in liquids, controlled humidity, varying temperature).\nOther characterisation equipment For a full list of the facilities available to us, please visit the Department of Materials Science \u0026amp; Metallurgy website.\n","permalink":"//mml-cambridge.github.io/facilities/","summary":"The Macromolecular Materials Laboratory either owns or has access to top-of-the-line equipment for characterising a wide range of physical (mechanical, thermal, electrical, structural) properties of nanomaterials.

He obtained his MA in Natural Sciences (Physics) from Cambridge, and his PhD in Polymer Physics at the University of Bristol. He was a JSPS Invitation Fellow and Visiting Professor at the University of Tokyo in 2008, and collaborates with several groups working on CNT synthesis and thermal properties of CNT-polymer composites.\n+44 (0)1223 335987\njae1001@cam.ac.uk\nPhD students: Conor Williams Hi! I started my PhD in 2020, my research is focused on developing off-lattice kinetic Monte Carlo methods to enable the simulation of solid-state systems into extended timescales. I\u0026rsquo;m a self-proclaimed C++ addict, you can find out about some of my projects on GitHub.\nBen Seddon I started my PhD in 2019 as part of the CDT in Computational Methods for Materials Science. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to develop machine learned interatomic potentials for iron that take into account both the magnetic and spatial atomic degrees of freedom. This is important as the magnetic interactions affect iron\u0026rsquo;s structural properties, for example by stabilising the room temperature phase. I\u0026rsquo;ve been using constrained Density Functional Theory (cDFT) to generate the training data as this allows me to treat the atomic magnetic moments as inputs in the same way as the positions.\nPatience Abugu I had my undergraduate degree at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, where I studied Pure and Industrial Chemistry. After this, I undertook an Erasmus Mundus joint master degree course in Chemical Nanoengineering with semester rotations in France, Poland and Italy. My master thesis was based on the chemical functionalisation of nanosilica with aminosilane in supercritical carbon dioxide for the preparation of starch-nanosilica composites. My PhD at the University of Cambridge started in October 2022 and I am investigating cellulose nanofibers (CNF) from lignocellulosic biomass, their chemical modification and blends with other biomaterials such as proteins. Ultimately, the aim is to develop bio-based plastic materials with comparable mechanical and gas barrier properties to oil-based plastics used in food packaging. The bio-based plastics will have the added advantage of being biodegradable and/or compostable at the end of their useful life.\nThomas Højlund-Dodd Before arriving at Cambridge, I completed an MSc in the study of Energy Systems at the University of Oxford, where I wrote my thesis on the modelling of hybrid renewable energy systems and their integration with hydrogen electrolysers. This followed three years at the University of Manchester where I obtained my BSc in Environmental Science; specialising in the geochemical modelling of interactions between low-temperature fluids and high-strength rock. As part of Cambridge’s AI4ER CDT programme’s 2021 cohort, I finished my first-year MRes with a project on the optimisation of carbon mineralisation in basaltic rock using a sequence of reactive transport model simulation, gradient boosted decision tree emulation, and Bayesian optimisation. Moving from the Department of Earth Sciences to the Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy for my PhD, I currently study the potential for Bayesian optimisation to accelerate the development of sustainable properties in thermoset plastic materials. Current work is split between looking at improvements to recyclability as well as increasing the quantities of sustainably derived feedstocks used.\nDanny van der Haven I currently study the compaction of pharmaceutical powders in close collaboration with Novo Nordisk. The majority of my work is computational, focusing on the use and development of numerical methods such as the finite element method (FEM) and discrete element method (DEM). I eventually hope to create a full-scale model of powder compaction that can be parameterised bottom-up by using single-particle data. Before my PhD, I completed the MPhil in Scientific Computing here in Cambridge. Before coming to Cambridge, I did a bachelors in Biomedical Engineering and a master\u0026rsquo;s in Chemical Engineering at Eindhoven University of Technology, mainly focusing on soft matter physics and chemistry.\nJokūbas Pelanskis Hellooo! I started my PhD in 2022, my research focuses on mesoscale simulation of thin ionomer films using many-body dissipative particle dynamics. My project aims to improve our understanding of the catalyst layer, which is often manufactured from a thin layer of Nafion. Good understanding of the morphology might help to reduce the cost of the fuel cell by reducing the amount of expensive plattinum within the cell without sacrificing the effciency.\nGhanshyam Hirani Hola! Bonjour! Ciao! 你好! I started my PhD in 2020. My project investigates the reinforcing effects of adding graphene nanoplatlets (GNPs) to mechanically recycled polypropylene (rPP) as a method to ameliorate the effects of degradation and recover some of the properties relative to virgin PP (vPP), and provide a mechanistic understanding of the evolution of behaviour within the polymer matrix. Prior to this, I completed an MRes in Graphene Technology at the Department of Engineering here at Cambridge, focusing on the design and fabrication of non-invasive glucose monitoring for diabetes patients using novel graphene-based co-planar waveguide microsensors. I also researched sustainable production methods of multilayer graphene using cellulose nanocrystals in collaboration with the Department of Chemistry. Before Cambridge, I completed a BSc (Hons) in Chemistry and Biomedicine from King\u0026rsquo;s College London. My 3rd year chemistry project looked into electrochemical energy conversion and storage, focusing on hydrogen fuel cells and batteries, and my 3rd year biomedicine project looked into the synthesis and in-vitro testing of various classes of transition metal anti-cancer drugs. I undertooked an MSc in Renewable Energy systems at UCL where I worked on the design and fabrication of ultra-low cost microbial fuel cells (MFCs) for simultaneous wastewater remediation and power generation. Following this, I worked as a visiting researcher at UCL\u0026rsquo;s Department of Environmental Engineering specifically looking into microstructural control of low-cost MFC electrodes and ceramic membranes, and designed pilot scale models for wastewater remediation for implementation in rural Brazilian communities.\nI am currently a postdoctoral research associate in smart cellulose nanofibril films in the group of Prof. James A. Elliott, closely collaborating with Prof. Paul Dupree and Prof. Jonathan M. Cullen for the Smart Sustainable Packaging from Plants (S2UPPlant, NERC) project at the University of Cambridge. I obtained my PhD degree in sustainable energy nanomaterials from the University of Bristol (2018-2022) under the supervision of Prof. Stephen J. Eichhorn, in close collaboration with Prof. Magda Titirici at Imperial College London. My PhD research focused on developing sustainable cellulose nanocrystals-based nanocomposites as electrodes and separators for next-generation energy storage technologies. Moreover, I completed an MSc degree in Advanced Composites at the University of Bristol (2017-2018), researching toughened composites using electrospun cellulose nanocrystals/polyetherimide nanofibrous interleaves.\n","permalink":"//mml-cambridge.github.io/people/","summary":"James Elliott Professor of Macromolecular Materials Science\nFellow, Tutor and Director of Studies in Natural Sciences (Fitzwilliam College)\nJames Elliott is Professor of Macromolecular Materials in the University of Cambridge, where he carries out research on multiscale computational modelling of soft matter systems, including coarse-grained and molecular modelling of polymers, carbon nanotubes and their composites.
